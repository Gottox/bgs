.SH DESCRIPTION
The bgs program allows you to tailor the appearance of the background ("root")
window on a workstation display running X.

bgs uses imlib2 for image rendering and rotates the images automaticly. It
is made for dynamic Xinerama/Xrandr setups such as used with notebooks,
but it works very fine in any setup.

bgs can't decide how the a monitor is rotated if you use xrandr-rotation,
so it assumes the monitor is rotated clockwise.
