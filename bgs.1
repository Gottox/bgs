.SH DESCRIPTION
bgs allows you to tailor the appearance of the background ("root") window on
a workstation display running X.
.P
bgs uses imlib2 for image rendering and rotates the images automaticly. It
is designed for dynamic Xinerama/Xrandr setups such as those used with notebooks,
but it works well in any setup.

the root window changes.

.BR dwm (1)

.SH BUGS
bgs can't decide how the monitor is rotated if you use xrandr-rotation,
so it assumes the monitor is rotated clockwise.
