.SH DESCRIPTION
bgs allows you to tailor the appearance of the background ("root") window on
a workstation display running X.
.P
bgs uses imlib2 for image rendering and rotates the images automaticly. It
is designed for dynamic Xinerama/Xrandr setups such as those used with notebooks,
but it works well in any setup.

.B \-v

.BR xsetroot (1)
.SH BUGS
bgs can't decide how the monitor is rotated if you use xrandr-rotation,
so it assumes the monitor is rotated clockwise.
