bgs - back ground setter
========================
bgs is an extremely fast and small background setter for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build bgs you need the Xlib and Imlib2 header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (bgs is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install bgs (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running bgs
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start bgs using startx:

    bgs <image> &

In order to connect bgs to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 bgs <image> &

(This will start bgs on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)
