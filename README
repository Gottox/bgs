bgs - back ground setter
========================
bgs is an extremely fast and small background setter for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build bgs you need the Xlib and Imlib2 header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (bgs is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install bgs (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running bgs
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start bgs using startx:

    bgs <image> &

In order to connect bgs to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 bgs <image> &

(This will start bgs on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to have a different image on each monitor you can specify
multiple images (one per monitor), e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 bgs <image1> <image2> &

(This will display image1 on monitor 1 and image2 on monitor 2.)
